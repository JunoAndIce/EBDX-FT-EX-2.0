# Instructions:
#
# Use the call: pbGenderSelector to play the scene. You can have the script show
# the trainer sprite, instead of the Intro sprites in Pictures, by changing the
# lines:
#
# TRAINERMALE       = "Graphics/Pictures/introBoy"
# TRAINERFEMALE     = "Graphics/Pictures/introGirl"
#
# to:
#
# TRAINERMALE       = "Graphics/Trainers/trainer000"
# TRAINERFEMALE     = "Graphics/Trainers/trainer001"
#
# Otherwise, is a pretty forward script.

# write your trainer name
